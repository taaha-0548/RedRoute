Here’s a **detailed Replit project prompt** you can use to either kickstart development or invite collaborators to work on **RedRoute**, your Flutter + Mapbox app that helps people navigate Karachi’s RedBus network.

---

## 📍 Project Title:

**RedRoute — A Smart Karachi Bus Navigation App (Flutter + Mapbox)**

---

## 📝 Project Description:

**RedRoute** is a mobile application designed to help users in Karachi navigate the RedBus public transport system. It helps them get from their **current location** to their **desired destination** using the nearest BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) stops and routes. The app leverages **Mapbox for mapping**, **Flutter for cross-platform UI**, and optionally a lightweight backend (Firebase or FastAPI) for advanced logic and analytics.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals:

* Allow users to enter any destination in Karachi
* Identify the nearest BRT stop to the destination
* Match routes and find the nearest stop to the user's current location
* Display directions: walking + bus journey + optional transfers
* Show the full route visually using Mapbox (stops, polylines)
* Suggest how to reach the boarding stop (walk, rickshaw, Bykea)
* Be simple, responsive, and functional on Android devices

## 📦 Tech Stack:

| Component        | Tool/Framework                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Frontend         | **Flutter**                            |
| Maps & UI        | **Mapbox** via `mapbox_gl` plugin      |
| Location Access  | `geolocator`, `permission_handler`     |
| Data Storage     | JSON (offline), optionally Firebase    |
| Optional Backend | FastAPI (Python) or Firebase Functions |

---

## 📁 Data Files:

We use a static dataset of Karachi’s BRT bus stops and their routes in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Malir Halt",
    "lat": 24.8733,
    "lng": 67.1592,
    "routes": ["Route 1", "Route 9"]
  },
  ...
]
```

File location: `assets/brt_stops.json`

## 🗺️ Core Features:

### ✅ 1. Get User Location

* Use GPS to determine where the user currently is.

### ✅ 2. Destination Input

* Users can either:

  * Type a place name or stop
  * Drop a pin on the map

### ✅ 3. Nearest Stop Detection

* Find the closest BRT stop to the destination (based on Haversine distance)
* Then find a matching route and the closest stop on that route near the user

### ✅ 4. Route Matching & Transfers

* If no direct route exists, suggest a **transfer stop** that connects the two routes

### ✅ 5. Route Visualization

* Show all relevant stops on the route
* Draw the bus path using Mapbox polylines
* Mark:

  * 🟢 Current location
  * 🔵 Nearest stop
  * 🔴 Destination stop

### ✅ 6. Journey Suggestion

* Text-based step-by-step directions
* Mode suggestion:

  * <500m → walk
  * 500m–2km → rickshaw
  * > 2km → Bykea (link to app)

## ✅ Future Features (Optional / Phase 2):

* User login system with Firebase
* Saving favorite routes
* Real-time bus tracking (when supported by BRT)
* Reverse routing (e.g., destination to home)
* Urdu language toggle

## 🔧 Installation Instructions:

1. Ensure Replit supports Flutter (use a Flutter template Repl)
2. Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  mapbox_gl: ^0.16.0
  geolocator: ^10.0.0
  permission_handler: ^11.0.0
  flutter_typeahead: ^5.0.0
  provider: ^6.0.0
```

3. Add your `Mapbox Access Token` to `main.dart` or environment config

4. Add the `brt_stops.json` to `/assets/` and include it in `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/brt_stops.json
```
